The Reason Behind This Repository

One of the insights I have gained from being a teacher is a deeper understanding of the learning process. If you have ever worked with kindergarten students then 
you understand that it's a messy process, but that's just how they learn. More so, that's how everyone learns. It is only through lots of trial and error that we 
are able then to understand something. And it's often this part of the learning process we often forget about, or just want to skip entirely. 

My reason for creating this repository is to ground me to the process of learning, and to not get carried away by high expectations of writing clean code right from
the start. This is a reminder for me that not everything I make has to be absolutely perfect, perfection is the enemy of good enough. In fact, I want to actually 
encourage myself to bad code because it at least means I'm writing code in some form or another. 

My experience as a teacher has taught me that high expectations take away from the learning process as it limits creativity and breeds frustration. Then when we 
lower expectations we are allowed to venture into the world with an open mind, open to new ideas and methods of doing things. I view coding as a creative art in 
the sense that there are multiple solutions to any one problem, which is precisely why creativity should be encouraged in the learning process. This repository 
is my way of documenting my own learning process to show my personal progression through my successes, and more importantly my failures. Just as an artist will 
have awful drawings in the beginning of their career, it's only because of those awful drawings were they able to perfect their craft. I see coding as no different.
